# HostCheck
Host Availability and Port Scanning Script

This script is designed to check the availability of hosts within a specified IP range and optionally scan for open ports. The results are output in JSON format, which can be further processed or analyzed.

## Features

- **Host Availability Check**: Pings hosts within a given IP range to check if they are alive.
- **Port Scanning**: Optionally scans the top 100 ports commonly targeted by attackers.
- **Banner Grabbing**: Retrieves banners for open ports to identify running services.
- **JSON Output**: Outputs the results in JSON format for easy processing and analysis.
- **Concurrency**: Utilizes asynchronous programming to efficiently handle multiple hosts and ports.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `scapy` library
- `asyncio` library
- `socket` library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```sh
pip install scapy
```

## Usage

```sh
./HostCheck.py <ip_prefix> [--scan-ports] [--output-file <output_file>]
```

- `ip_prefix`: IP address or prefix (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24` or `192.168.1.1`)
- `--scan-ports`: Enable port scanning (optional)
- `--output-file <output_file>`: Output JSON file to store results (optional)

### Examples

1. Check host availability within a subnet:

    ```sh
    ./HostCheck.py 192.168.1.0/24 --output-file results.json
    ```

2. Check host availability and scan for open ports:

    ```sh
    ./HostCheck.py 192.168.1.0/24 --scan-ports --output-file results.json
    ```

3. Check a single host:

    ```sh
    ./HostCheck.py 192.168.1.1 --output-file results.json
    ```

### Example Output

Here is an example of the JSON output generated by the script:

```json
[
    {
        "ip": "192.168.1.1",
        "ports": [
            {
                "port": 80,
                "banner": "Apache httpd 2.4.41"
            },
            {
                "port": 22,
                "banner": "OpenSSH 7.9"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "ip": "192.168.1.2",
        "ports": []
    }
]
```
